The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the
mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is
determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by
creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated,
respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following two rules are
applied to every cell:


- Any live cell with fewer than two or more than 3 live neighbors dies.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
